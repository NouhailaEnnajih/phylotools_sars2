## **Abstract**
Phylogenetic analysis is considered to be a highly reliable and important bioinformatics tool.Currently we have many phylogenetic tools that biologists can use to interpret and visualize biological data.However,most of these tools require a lot of expertise and technical know-how for one to be able to use them.In this study,African SARS-CoV-2 Variants are used to compare three phylogenetic tools(MEGA, Seaview and Galaxy) in terms of their ease of use,output and accessibility.
